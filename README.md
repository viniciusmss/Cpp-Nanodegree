# C++ Nanodegree
Projects associated with Udacity's C++ Nanodegree.

This repository contains material related to Udacity's C++ Nanodegree program and is composed of clones from the project-specific repos with functionality added by me according to the each project's tasks.

- [Route Planning](https://github.com/viniciusmss/Cpp-Nanodegree/tree/master/CppND-Route-Planning-Project): Implement the A* search algorithm to find a path between two nodes on a map.
- [System Monitor](https://github.com/viniciusmss/Cpp-Nanodegree/tree/master/CppND-System-Monitor): Build a simple version of a system monitor for Linux that profiles both CPU and memory usage.
- [Memory Management Chatbot](https://github.com/viniciusmss/Cpp-Nanodegree/tree/master/CppND-Memory-Management-Chatbot): Practice memory management techniques, with a focus on smart pointers, via a simple chatbot application.
- [Concurrent Traffic Simulation](https://github.com/viniciusmss/Cpp-Nanodegree/tree/master/CppND-Concurrent-Traffic-Simulation): Program a traffic simulator that models intersections, vehicles, and traffic lights as independent threads. Coordinate data access via a message queue to exchange information among threads.
- [Snake Game](https://github.com/viniciusmss/Cpp-Nanodegree/tree/master/CppND-Capstone-Snake-Game): Write a simple AI agent to play the Snake Game.
